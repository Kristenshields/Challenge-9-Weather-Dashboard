## Description
This weather dashboard application helps travelers plan their trips by providing real-time and forecasted weather conditions for selected cities. The application is built with a front-end interface, and this project focuses on connecting the back-end with the front-end to deliver data from the OpenWeather API. The application also supports a search history feature, enabling users to revisit previously searched cities.



## Features
- **City Search**: Users can input city names to retrieve current and future weather data.
- **Search History**: Previously searched cities are saved, allowing quick access to their weather details.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Displays a detailed forecast with key weather metrics for the upcoming five days.
- **Current Weather**: Shows the current weather conditions including an icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more.

## API Integration
The weather data is retrieved using the OpenWeather API's 5-day weather forecast endpoint:
```bash
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
```
To work with the API:
1. Register for an API key from OpenWeather.
2. Be aware that it may take up to 2 hours for the API key to activate after registration.
3. Refer to the OpenWeather API documentation for detailed usage.
